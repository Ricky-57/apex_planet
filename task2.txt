Short Note on Basic CRUD Application with Authentication
Objective:
Develop a simple PHP web application that performs CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on blog posts and includes basic user authentication.

1. Database Setup:

Database Name: blog

Tables:

users (id, username, password)

posts (id, title, content, created_at)

2. CRUD Operations:

Create: PHP form to add new posts.

Read: Display all posts in a list format.

Update: Edit form to update existing posts.

Delete: Delete button to remove posts.

3. User Authentication:

Registration/Login Forms: Allow user sign-up and login.

Password Security: Use password_hash() and password_verify().

Session Management: Use PHP sessions ($_SESSION) to track logged-in users.

Deliverables:

Fully functional PHP CRUD application with user login/registration.

Secure password handling and session control.

MySQL database schema and PHP source code.
